# My Dream App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.1.
So its their "fault" i named my project my-dream-app<br>
But then again, thats should be the point here, to show my dreamy ideas and that i can achieve them all

## My Show Case

The App 
### [My Dream App](https://bresleveloper.github.io/ng4/)
My Blog 
### [Bresleveloper](https://bresleveloper.blogspot.co.il/)

## Road Map

So for now, i want this to be a standard show case with all standard elements and pages so..

## Pages to Build

Master, *MegaMenu* (fixed), Home (slider, static msgs, live msgs, birthdays), Animations, Articles, Search, About, Contact (form)<br>
Home - Slider / static + feed / birthday long low<br>
Articles - list / Search - list / Article - item<br>
Animations page<br>
connect to API - my server app, Firebase<br>
About / Contact (form)<br>

## Da Dream

NgCf : angular client forms platform, simple server side setting and you have all you validations running server and client PLUS auto server validation, something cool, i made it once, i want to do it again.
