# My Dream App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.1.
So its their "fault" i named my project my-dream-app

## My Show Case

But then again, thats should be the point here, to show my dreamy ideas and that i can achieve them all

Take a look in my Blog https://bresleveloper.blogspot.co.il/

Take at the app https://bresleveloper.github.io/ng4/

## Road Map

So for now, i want this to be a standard show case with all standard elements and pages so..

## Pages to Build

Master, *MegaMenu* (fixed), Home (slider, static msgs, live msgs, birthdays), Animations, Articles, Search, About, Contact (form)

Home - Slider / static + feed / birthday long low

Articles - list / Search - list / Article - item

Animations page

connect to API - my server app, Firebase

About / Contact (form)

## Da Dream

NgCf : angular client forms platform, simple server side setting and you have all you validations running server and client PLUS auto server validation, something cool, i made it once, i want to do it again.
